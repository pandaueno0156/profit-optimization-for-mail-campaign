# profit-optimization-for-mail-campaign

## Project Background
A supermarket company (**the client**) has conducted a mail campaign with credit cards offers without segmenting its customers in the past, resulting in a not too profitable outcome

## Project Goal
Analyzing customers' data to identify customers' trait in accepting/rejecting the credit cards offer and predict the profitability of the future mail campaign with the segmentation of customers

## Data and the Analysis Process
We received 2 sets of data from **the client**. For one of the set, we will use it to create and fine-tuning the logistic regression model. For the other set, we will use it to predict the probability of customers accepting the mail campaign for the calculation of the profitability

## Essential Information
**The client** sending out a email to a customer costs $1 while **the client** can receive $12.5 per offer accepted by customers

In the past campaign, **the client** sent out 10,000 mails to customers and had 882 customers accepted the offers

**The client** wants to conduct a new mail campaign targeting towards 10,000 perspective customers who have not been contacted for the credit card offer campaign

## Result
**837%** increase in profitability with 80% model accuracy
